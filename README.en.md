## ESI'Flipside

>TODO / **short description challenge**

Our team has chosen the challenge **The right address** bringed by **EDF and Réunion THD**

This challenge is part of a context where many public and private organizations have lists of addresses that, collected over time, are rarely checked or updated. As a result, the quality of this information is gradually deteriorating, making it difficult to use them efficiently. This challenge consists of comparing the source address data with existing repositories, identifying incorrect data and give possible solutions to correct them.

Its objective here is to design a prototype tool to help correct an address file. This tool, based on a comparison with data from the BAN (National Address Base) and ARCEP, will not only detect differences between sources and repositories, but also suggest relevant corrections. In addition, a statistical analysis of the quality of the source data and a cartographic visualization of the addresses will also be included in the prototype.
